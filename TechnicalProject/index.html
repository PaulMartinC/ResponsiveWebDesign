            Cybersecurity of all times now is the best time to get in since absolutely everything is connected to the internet nowadays. It wasnt always like this and altough we have alot of protections in place now it took alot growth and problems to get here alot of the protections in place all started with simple programs that werent originally made for malicious intent. The First Major Malware Attacks were Known as 
Brain Virus and Morris Worm which would become the base of lots of major and modern viruses 
<br><br>
<h1>Viruses</h1>
==**Brain Virus**== was made in 1986 its intended purpose was made to track illegal copies of medical software, if a computer used illegal software it would get infected with a virus and after installed any disk inserted into infected device would get this virus as well. It would overwrite the boot sector of a floppy disk, essentially preventing the computer from booting up properly and displaying a message claiming the machine was infected, often asking the user to contact the creators for "inoculation" as a way to combat software piracy; it primarily affected MS-DOS based computers and slowed down the floppy disk drive significantly once infected. 
-*Infected over 100,000 Computers Which at the time was 10% of the worlds computers although it didn’t cause data damage it slowed major global operations until it got patched from computers.* <br><br>

*==Morris Worm==* was made in 1988 and was suppose to be a program that would find out the size of the internet. Once it was released it would scour the internet and install itself onto devices on the internet but what the creator forgot to do was put a preventive measure to check if the program was already installed so when devices installed it it would keep installing till the system runs out of memory and crashes.
-*This was released inside the private Cornell University network and within 24 hours, an estimated 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 computers on the network were infected. The exact damages were difficult to quantify, but estimates started at $100,000 and soared into the millions.*<br><br>
<p>Here’s a simple pseudocode example of how the Morris Worm might have endlessly replicated without a proper check:</p>
<code>while true:
    infect_next_device()
</code><br>
<p>although pseudocode captures the idea of an infinite replication loop, the actual Morris Worm was a bit more sophisticated in its infection logic.</p>
<br>

**==Love Letter Virus==** was initially made in the 2000s to steal internet login credentials,  also known as ILOVEYOU or the Love Bug, was a computer worm that infected millions of Windows computers in 2000. It spread via email with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and an attachment named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs" The worm appeared as a text file, but when opened, it downloaded itself into the user's system and spread to their contacts. Recipients assumed the email was a love declaration or joke, and opened it, helping to spread the virus.
-*over 50 million computers we infected which again at this time was 10% of all computers on the internet. The virus caused an estimated $5.5–8.7 billion in damages and cost $10–15 billion to remove.* <br><br>

<h1>Data Breach</h1> <br>

The first reported data breach in the United States occurred in 2002, when 250,000 Social Security numbers were stolen from a California data center. Since then their have been many many more breaches from many major companies.<br><br>

In 2024 someone compiled 12TB of leaked user data from 3,876 domains which is a data leak of 26 billion records its known as Mother Of All Breaches (MOAB) <br><br>

-2013 Yahoo had a Data breach which hackers compromised 3 billion yahoo accounts which leaked their names emails and address. 
<br><br>
-2017 ***Equifax Breach*** was a major attack on the credit reporting agency Equifax which is known as one of the largest data breaches of sensitive information which compromised over 143 million customer record's and affected 40% of all American’s, The breach caused over 575 millions of dollars to resolve. 
<br><br>
-2024 the National Public Data was hacked which gave hackers access to billions of social security’s and other sensitive data

            Here’s an example of a secure function in Python that validates input to prevent injection attacks:
        </p>
        <code>def validate_input(input):
    if not input.isalnum():
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    return input
</code>
        <p>
          function does prevent non-alphanumeric characters from being processed—which might block certain injection patterns—it is not a comprehensive solution for preventing injection attacks in real-world applications.<br><br>

    grant_access()
else:
    deny_access()
</code>
          <p>
            Although this works in a basic scenario but is not secure enough for real-world applications. A more robust access control system should be implemented to prevent privilege escalation.<br><br>

        <article>
            A framework is a pre-built software that used as a foundation for projects without having to start from scratch. This makes the task of developers easy and less time-consuming. A framework takes care of the low-level functionality of the application such that the developers can entirely focus on the high-level aspects of the application.
<br><br>
            A ***cybersecurity framework*** is a set of rules common to all security leaders that they must abide by. It is a set of standards and practices that organizations follow to reduce cybersecurity risks. They help the company to identify its weak spots that might lead to data breaches and cyber-attacks. Every organization has a risk management strategy, which when combined with a cybersecurity framework, protects the organization from cyber-attacks. 
<br><br>
            A cybersecurity framework is incomplete without these 5 major functions:
            <ul>
                <li>Identify</li>
                <p>It involves the basic task of figuring out what needs to work upon and why. This includes collecting information about the system in order to identify the security risks.</p>
                <li>Protect</li>
                <p>Based on the risks identified, this function involves the necessary guidelines that might be needed in order to protect the system.</p>
                <li>Detect</li>
                <p>It is a very important function as it helps in detecting a cybersecurity breach before a huge loss occurs.</p>
                <li>Respond</li>
                <p>After identifying the risks, the next task is to respond accordingly. This step involves conveying information as needed.</p>
                <li>Recover</li>
                <p>It includes making up for previous cyber risks and attacks.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>A cybersecurity framework is like a bare minimum set of rules that all organizations must follow.  However, there is always a scope for improvement by adding their systems to the framework. Helps mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
<br>
                They also provide a structured approach to implementing a Security LifeCycle</p>

        <article>
            the Cybersecurity Framework's five Functions— <b>Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover</b>—are built upon the components of the framework model and act as a backbone around which other framework core elements are organized. They represent the primary pillars of a successful and holistic cybersecurity program. Additionally, they can help organizations by easily expressing their management of cybersecurity risk at a high level and enabling risk management decisions.

<p>            The cybersecurity lifecycle is a process that includes several stages, from identifying and protecting essential assets to recovering from cybersecurity breaches. The lifecycle is an ongoing process that helps organizations improve their cybersecurity posture and prepare for future threats.
